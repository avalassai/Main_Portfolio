            <p>RRR[a] is a 2022 Indian Telugu-language epic action drama film directed by S. S. Rajamouli, who co-wrote the film with V. Vijayendra Prasad. It was produced by D. V. V. Danayya of DVV Entertainment. The film stars N. T. Rama Rao Jr., Ram Charan, Ajay Devgn, Alia Bhatt, Shriya Saran, Samuthirakani, Ray Stevenson, Alison Doody, and Olivia Morris. It centers around two real-life Indian revolutionaries, Alluri Sitarama Raju (Charan) and Komaram Bheem (Rama Rao), their fictional friendship and their fight against the British Raj. Set in the 1920s, the plot explores the undocumented period in their lives when both the revolutionaries chose to go into obscurity before they began the fight for their country.

                Rajamouli came across stories about the lives of Rama Raju and Bheem and connected the coincidences between them, imagining what would have happened had they met, and been friends. The film was formally announced in March 2018. Principal photography of the film began in November 2018 in Hyderabad and continued until August 2021, owing to delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The film was shot extensively across India, with a few sequences filmed in Ukraine and Bulgaria. The film's soundtrack and background score were composed by M. M. Keeravani, with cinematography by K. K. Senthil Kumar and editing by A. Sreekar Prasad. Sabu Cyril is the film's production designer whilst V. Srinivas Mohan supervised the visual effects.
                
                Made on a budget of ₹550 crore ($72 million), RRR is the most expensive Indian film to date. The film was initially scheduled for theatrical release on 30 July 2020, which was postponed multiple times due to production delays and the pandemic. RRR was released theatrically on 25 March 2022, and received universal acclaim for Rajamouli's direction, writing, performances of the cast (particularly of Rama Rao and Charan's), soundtrack, background score, action sequences, cinematography, editing, and VFX.[5]
                
                With ₹240 crore (US$30 million) worldwide on its first day, RRR broke the record for the highest opening-day collection earned by an Indian film. RRR emerged as the highest-grossing film in its home market of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, grossing over ₹415 crore (US$52 million) and surpassing Rajamouli's previous film Baahubali 2.[6] The film grossed ₹1,200 crore (US$175.47 million) worldwide, setting several box office records for an Indian film, including the third highest-grossing Indian film and second highest-grossing Telugu film worldwide. It also went on to become the highest-earning Indian film in Japan.[7] RRR became the third Indian film and the first Telugu film to receive nominations at the Golden Globes, nominated in the Best Non-English Language Film category and for the Best Original Song.[8][9] It was nominated in three categories at the 47th Saturn Awards and won the Best International Film award. The film was considered one of the best films of the year by the National Board of Review, only the second non-English film to make achieve that distinction.[10]

                Plot
                In 1920, during the British Raj, administrator Scott Buxton and his wife Catherine visit a forest in Adilabad, where they abduct Malli, a young girl with a talent for artistry, from the Gond tribe. Enraged by the act, the tribe's guardian Komaram Bheem, embarks to Delhi with the intent of rescuing her, under the guise of a Muslim man named Akhtar. Elsewhere, the Nizamate of Hyderabad, sympathetic to the Raj, warns Scott's office of the impending danger. Undeterred, Catherine enlists the assistance of A. Rama Raju, an ambitious officer in the Indian Imperial Police to quell the threat. Embarking on his new assignment, Raju and his uncle, Venkateswarulu, attend several pro-independence gatherings in the hopes of finding clues. His opinions attract the attention of Lachhu, Bheem's gullible aide.
                
                Falling for Raju's trickery, he attempts to induct him into Bheem's plot, only to flee when he discovers his true identity. A short while later, both Bheem and Raju encounter each other; unaware of their opposing identities and intentions, they unite to save a boy from a train wreck, sparking a friendship between the two. Over time, the two grow close to each other. Raju subsequently assists Bheem in courting Jenny, Scott's niece, unaware of his intention to infiltrate Scott's residence. When Jenny takes Bheem to her residence, Bheem locates the room where Malli is being held in captivity; he meets Malli and promises Malli that he will free her. Meanwhile, Raju deduces Lachhu's covert identity and whereabouts; he subsequently apprehends him. While interrogating him, Lachhu goads a banded krait into attacking Raju; he thereafter warns him of his imminent fate and that the antidote is only known to the Gonds.
                
                Dazed, Raju approaches Bheem, who immediately tends to him. Noticing similar religious features between Lachhu and Bheem, Raju deduces his true intentions. Regardless, Bheem divulges his tribal identity and his mission, still unaware of Raju's covert identity. At an event held in Scott's honor, Bheem's men barge into his residence with a lorry filled with wild animals, which creates havoc among the assembled guests. The animals maul Scott's guards, allowing Bheem to briefly fight; however, Raju arrives and subsequently discloses to him of Scott's intention to kill Malli; he surrenders out of obligation. In the aftermath of the incident, Raju is promoted for thwarting Bheem, yet, he is absorbed with guilt over his own actions, recalling his own pro-nationalistic background and his actual alter-ego as a mole within the police; he was seeking a promotion in order to gain access to shipments of guns to smuggle to his village.
                
                At Bheem's public flogging, Raju attempts to persuade him into recanting his actions; the former chooses to be flogged instead. Resisting his injuries, Bheem sings in defiance, which incites an assembled crowd into rebelling. The riot further enlightens Raju, who finally realizes the recklessness of his actions. Determined to save his friend, he persuades Scott to secretly execute Bheem whilst preparing an ambush to save him; nevertheless, Scott deduces his plot. Whilst managing to rescue Malli from Scott's men, Raju is grievously injured. Bheem, who had simultaneously managed to free himself, mistakenly interprets Raju's actions as an attempt to kill Malli; he bludgeons him before escaping with her. Months later, Bheem, who had escaped with Malli to Hathras, is cornered by the colonial authorities; he narrowly avoids being exposed when Sita, Raju's fiancée, repels them by claiming of a smallpox epidemic as a pretext.
                
                Unaware of Bheem's identity, she reveals Raju's actual, anti-colonial objectives and of his impending execution. Crestfallen upon realizing his own folly, Bheem vows to save him. With the assistance of a sympathetic Jenny, Bheem infiltrates the barracks where Raju is detained and frees him, alerting multiple soldiers in the process. Defeating them, the pair retreat to a nearby forest, where they decimate more soldiers with the use of a longbow taken from a Ram shrine. Taking the fight to Scott, the pair hurl a flaming motorcycle into the barracks' magazines, which consequently ignites. The subsequent explosion kills many within Scott's company, including Catherine. Having finally cornered a wounded Scott, Raju has Bheem execute him with an English rifle, fulfilling their respective objectives. They subsequently steal a cache of Scott's weaponry, later reuniting with Sita and Jenny.
                
                In honor of completing their respective missions, Raju asks Bheem to let him grant a wish for him, to which, Bheem asks Raju to provide education to him and his community.

                Alluri Sitarama Raju (left) and Komaram Bheem (right), the real-life Indian revolutionaries whose lives were fictionalised in the film
                In October 2017, in an interview with Variety, S. S. Rajamouli announced two projects after Baahubali 2: The Conclusion (2017) with producers D. V. V. Danayya of DVV Entertainment and K. L. Narayana. Rajamouli prioritised his work on the former, which was touted to be a social drama film, and which would be followed by Narayana's production with actor Mahesh Babu.[11] In November 2017, Rajamouli shared a picture with N. T. Rama Rao Jr. and Ram Charan through his social media handles, hinting their inclusion in the film.[12]
                
                The film was officially announced in March 2018,[13] with the tentative title RRR, an abbreviation for Rajamouli, Ram Charan, and Rama Rao.[14] The tentative title RRR was later confirmed to be the film's official title as Rajamouli felt that a universal title across the languages was essential for a film of such scale.[15][16] Rajamouli's father V. Vijayendra Prasad gave the original story and Rajamouli scripted the film, which he worked on for six months.[17] In September 2018, writer Sai Madhav Burra was signed for the dialogues for the film in the primary language (Telugu),[18] whereas dialogues in other versions were written by Madhan Karky (Tamil),[19] Varadaraj Chikkaballapura (Kannada),[20] Mamkombu Gopalakrishnan (Malayalam),[21] and Riya Mukherjee (Hindi).[22] Rajamouli retained several technicians from his previous projects. The crew consists of M. M. Keeravani as the music director, K. K. Senthil Kumar as the director of photography, A. Sreekar Prasad as the film editor, Sabu Cyril as the production designer, V. Srinivas Mohan handling the visual effects supervision, and Rama Rajamouli as the costume designer.[23] Nick Powell was the stunt director for the film, and handled the choreography for the climax action sequences in the film.[24] Prior to the start of film production, both Rama Rao and Charan had attended a special workshop in mid-November 2018, in order to train physically and intensively for their roles in the film.[25][26]
                
                RRR is an entirely fictitious story incorporating the lives of two real-life Indian revolutionaries, namely Alluri Sitarama Raju and Komaram Bheem, who fought against the British Raj and the Nizam of Hyderabad respectively. Charan plays Rama Raju while Rama Rao plays Komaram Bheem. The plot explores their stay in Delhi of the 1920s before they begin the fight for their country.[27] Rajamouli stated that there had been a coincidence between the two Telugu tribal leaders and the events surrounding over them.[28]
                
                When I read about Alluri Sitarama Raju and Komaram Bheem, it was exciting to know that their story is similar. They never met each other. What if they had met? What if they had got inspired by each other? That is what RRR is about. It is completely fictitious. The film is mounted on a very large scale. We had to do a lot of research for it. To know costumes, their dialect, their way of living and that is why it took so much time for us to get this together.
                
                — S. S. Rajamouli[29]
                In March 2019, Rajamouli revealed that the film's core idea came from The Motorcycle Diaries (2004), saying that he was fascinated by "how a character named Che transforms into a revolutionary called Guevara and have structured the characters of my protagonists around a common point, on similar lines". In December 2021, in a press meet in Chennai, Rajamouli noted, "Inglourious Basterds is one of the biggest inspirations when it comes to my films, specifically RRR. I was shell shocked when Hitler dies in the film, and how the film brings it off as a big surprise."[30][31]

                Alia Bhatt (top), Ray Stevenson (middle) and Ajay Devgn (bottom) made their debut in Telugu cinema (Tollywood) in this film.
                In March 2019, Rajamouli finalized the cast. The film marks the Telugu debut of Ajay Devgn and Alia Bhatt.[32][33][34] Bhatt was paired opposite Charan in the role of Sita, while Devgn would have an extended cameo.[35] Tamil actor Samuthirakani was roped in to play a crucial role.[34] British actress Daisy Edgar-Jones was signed to be paired opposite Rama Rao,[34] however, she left the project in April 2019 citing personal reasons, which later revealed to be scheduling conflicts with a different project titled Normal People.[36] Olivia Morris was cast as her replacement in November 2019. The same month, Irish actor Ray Stevenson was cast as the lead antagonist Scott, with Alison Doody roped in to play Lady Scott.[37] Chakri, Varun Buddhadev and Spandan Chaturvedi were the child artists for the film.[38]
                
                In an interview with Deadline Hollywood, Rama Rao said that they had carried out major research to portray their characters on screen. He was put on an 18-month training programme to get the right physical appearance.[39] The Hans India reported in March 2019 that Devgn will appear in the second half of the film during the flashback episodes.[40] Reports claimed that Keerthy Suresh and Priyamani were approached for a role in the film,[41][42] before Shriya Saran confirmed her role opposite Devgn in June 2020.[43] Rahul Ramakrishna,[44] Chatrapathi Sekhar[45] and Rajeev Kanakala are cast in other supporting roles.[46]
                
                In June 2020, Bhatt was trolled by the netizens following the death of Sushant Singh Rajput, where she was accused of nepotism. A few fans also called to replace Bhatt in RRR.[47][48] However, Bhatt denied the news of her leaving the film and being replaced by Priyanka Chopra,[49] and joined the sets in December 2020.[50] She learnt to speak Telugu for the film.[51][52]
                
                Design
                Sabu Cyril served as the production designer for RRR.[23] Prior to starting the first shooting schedule, the team had constructed a set at an aluminium factory located in Hyderabad, for filming an action sequence.[53][54] A manduva house was constructed for the film actors and technicians.[55] The Aluminium factory set designed was considered the major filming location[citation needed] where the first schedule of the film's shooting was held.[53] In June 2020, it was reported that ₹18 crore (US$2.3 million) was spent for a set replicating an entire village in Gandipet, where the team planned to film the sequences in this location post-COVID-19 lockdown.[56] A set resembling the 20th-century Delhi was recreated at the Ramoji Film City,[50] where the team had undergone an extensive action schedule for 50 days, which involved night shoots.[57] Another huge set was constructed by the art direction crew for a song shoot featuring Charan and Bhatt.[58] The song was reported to replicate the 1920s period and had a historical touch.[citation needed] The promotional music video for the film titled "Dosti"[citation needed] was filmed in July 2021, at a specially constructed set at the Annapurna Studios designed by Sabu Cyril and photographed by Dinesh Krishnan.[citation needed][59][60]
                
                Principal photography
                The film's launch event with a puja ceremony was held on 11 November 2018, which saw the attendance of noted personalities from the Telugu film industry,[61] including Prabhas and Rana Daggubati, who had worked with Rajamouli in the Baahubali franchise.[62][63] Principal photography of the film commenced on 19 November 2018 in Hyderabad at a specially erected set at an Aluminium factory in the location.[53][54] It is the first Indian film to be shot on Arri Alexa LF and Arri Signature Prime lens.[64] Senthil Kumar told American Cinematographer that, he "avoided the use of overt stylization such as extreme color palettes and unrealistic camera moves, in favor of a more classical cinematographic approach".[65] The filming schedule was completed on 6 December 2018.[66] The team took a brief break before commencing the film's second schedule on 21 January 2019 at Ramoji Film City in Hyderabad.[67] An action sequence consisting of 1000 artists was filmed during February 2019.[68] An extensive schedule was filmed in Vadodara for 10 days in March 2019.[69] Few scenes were also shot at Siddhpur, Gujarat.[65] Another schedule was planned in Pune, Maharashtra, however, it was called off following Charan's injury on the sets.[70] Rama Rao too faced a minor injury on the sets,[71] resulting the team to take a break during the schedule.[72] Ram Charan's introduction scene was reportedly shot for 32 days.[73]
                
                
                Araku Valley, where the parts of the film were shot, including the opening scenes
                After their recovery, an action sequence featuring Charan, Rama Rao and 2000 junior artists was shot, reportedly at a cost more than ₹45 crore (US$5.6 million).[74] Introductory sequences of Rama Rao and Charan costed the production upwards of ₹40 crore (US$5.0 million), a sum considered higher than the total budget of many small Indian films.[75] In August 2019, the production headed to Bulgaria to film the second schedule where the crew shot crucial scenes featuring Rama Rao.[76] The shoot was stalled during October 2019 as Rajamouli had to attend a screening of Baahubali: The Beginning (2015) at the Royal Albert Hall in London.[77]
                
                In November 2019, two key sequences[citation needed] and a song featuring Rama Rao and Charan were filmed at the Ramoji Film City.[78] The film's official social media handle tweeted that 70% of the film's shoot had been wrapped as of November.[79] Rama Rao headed to the Modakondamma Temple forest area in the Paderu–Araku road to film for five days in December 2019.[80][81] In January 2020, Charan began a week-long night shoot in the Vikarabad forest region.[81] Ajay Devgn joined the film's shooting schedule on 21 January 2020 and wrapped his portions during February.[citation needed][82] The film was halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020.[83] After the governments of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana granted permission to resume film shooting during June 2020,[84] a 2-day trial shoot was planned, but it was halted following the spike in COVID-19 cases in Hyderabad.[85] The filming was resumed in early October 2020 following the ease of the COVID-19 lockdown in India,[86] and Rajamouli shot for the promotional teaser for the film, titled "Ramaraju for Bheem", during this schedule.[87] Abiding to social restrictions related to the pandemic, the production unit was accommodated in a hotel in Madhapur and were barred from coming into contact with outsiders not belonging to the production.[86]
                
                In late-October, the team canned night shoots for the film and stills were revealed by the official social media handles for the film under the tagline #RRRDiaries.[88][89] The action sequences, which took place for 50 days, were completed by the end of November 2020.[57] The production then moved to Mahabaleshwar to film a very brief schedule in early December 2020[clarification needed] and completed within 5 days.[citation needed][90] The production then moved to Ramoji Film City in Hyderabad for further filming.[91][92] Alia Bhatt began filming her portions in Hyderabad in December 2020, during which key scenes involving her were shot.[93][91] The filming of the climax scenes began in January 2021.[91] Action director Nick Powell choreographed few climax war-sequences in March 2021.[92] A special song shoot featuring Charan and Bhatt was held during the same month.[58] Though the filming was halted again due to the second wave of COVID-19,[94] it was resumed in June 2021.[95] In June 2021, the makers announced that except for two songs, the filming was completed and Charan and Rama Rao had completed their dubbing work in two languages,[96] and had completed the talkie portions for the film.[97]
                
                In August 2021, the final schedule of the film took place in Ukraine.[98] The song "Naatu Naatu" was shot during the schedule at Mariinskyi Palace, Kyiv.[99] Barring a few shots, the entire shoot was completed on 26 August 2021.[100] In an article published in March 2022, by News18, it was reported that at least 3000 technicians have worked on RRR, while nine co-directors also contributed to the film. It took over 300 days to complete the shooting of the film. About 75 days had been allotted to film the action sequences, and 40 fighters from other countries took part in the film. At least 2500 crew people were also hired from London. Overseas locations including Netherlands was also used for shooting some important sequences.[101]
                
                RRR began with a budget of between ₹350 crore (US$49.7 million) and ₹400 crore (US$56.8 million) in 2019.[102] However, the budget was overrun by around ₹150 crore (US$19 million) due to the delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic,[103] with the film's final budget estimated to be ₹550 crore (US$69 million),[104][3] thus making RRR the most expensive Indian film at the time of its release.[105] In March 2022, according to the producer's application to the Government of Andhra Pradesh for ticket price hikes, the film's budget was ₹336 crore (US$42 million) excluding the Goods and Services Tax and the remunerations of the director and star cast.[106]
                
                Post-production
                Post-production of the film began simultaneously with the wrapping-up and continuation of film production. The dubbing process began during April 2020, with Rama Rao and Charan dubbing their portions for the film from their homes, and thus being the first persons to do so.[107][108] Both actors gave voiceovers for each other's introduction teasers.[109][110] In June 2021, the film producers reported that both actors had completed dubbing for the film.[111] On 26 August 2021, after filming was completed, the film entered into an extensive post-production phase.[112] With three years already invested in the film, Rajamouli's decision to spend less time in post-production compared to his other films was due to future commitments, rising production costs, and filming postponements caused by COVID-19 restrictions.[113] The dubbing works were completed by late October 2021.[114] Both Rama Rao and Charan dubbed their lines for four languages for the film, namely Telugu, Tamil, Hindi, and Kannada.[115]

                Themes and influences
                "I was interested in the coincidence of these two freedom fighters, both born in Andhra Pradesh and present-day Telangana, at the turn of the 20th century. They left their respective homes, disappeared for three-four years, and then came back to fight against the oppressors. But their modus operandi was the same. They were striking police stations, taking away the guns, arming the people, inspiring the people. Unfortunately, they both died at the hands of the British in the same way. But they never met. I thought: What if we make them meet, create a rift between them, and then make each one inspire the other?"
                
                 — S. S. Rajamouli, on the genesis of the film.[120]
                RRR is about an "imaginary friendship between two superheroes," according to Rajamouli.[121] He has said that the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh, his home state, also had an impact in the conception of the film. "I had this thought that Komaram Bheem is from the Telangana region and Alluri Sitarama Raju is from the Andhra region. So, if I can bring those two heroes together, it's my way of saying we are one, we are not separate," Rajamouli told Variety following the film's release.[122] Countercurrents.org's T. Navin notes, "The friendship which develops between Ram and Bheem (as Akhtar) while attempting to rescue a child is one of human brotherhood. People cutting across all religions and regions are shown participating in their common fight against the Britishers. The film builds idea of love between religions, camaraderie of the struggling people and promotes the idea of inclusion."[123] Some viewers in India and the Western world viewed their relationship through a queer lens, arguing that they were a queer coded romantic couple on social media; however, others responded with critical and homophobic comments, claiming that Westerners assigning such readings had misinterpreted Indian culture and male friendships.[124][125] Writing for Firstpost, Prathyush Parasuraman stated that their relationship had "all the trappings of a conventional heterosexual romance", pointing to the use of similar tropes and the distance placed between the men and the women the narrative romantically partners them with.[126] However, unperturbed by such opinions, Rajamouli reiterated that it was just a friendship, and how one should be unapologetic about showing men’s friendship on screen.[127] American filmmaker Joe Russo similarly found it to be "a really powerful story about brotherhood."[128]
                
                RRR borrows from India's two major Hindu mythological epics — Ramayana and Mahabharata. The two protagonists of the film, Alluri Sitarama Raju and Komaram Bheem, who are based on real-life personalities, are also modelled after their namesakes from the Hindu mythology. Rama Raju shares the qualities of supple and skilled Rama of Ramayana while Komaram Bheem is equivalent to muscular and immovable Bhima of Mahabharata. Like Rama Raju and Komaram Bheem, Rama and Bhima never met in mythology. The abduction of Sita, which is the central theme of Ramayana plays out in reverse in RRR, with Rama Raju being captured following a series of events. Komaram Bheem (who is also modeled after Hanuman), carries a message from Sita, and saves Rama Raju.[129]
                
                The Indian Express's Manoj Kumar wrote that unlike other Rajamouli's films, RRR addresses worldly matters such as "racism, shared history of freedom struggle among different communities and the need for interfaith brotherhood."[130] An article was published by The Times of India in April 2022 writing about how pan-Indian films such as RRR are promoting violence. Speaking about the issue, writer V. Vijayendra Prasad told that RRR showcased action as per the story and era it takes place in, not violence.[131]
                
                Kaveree Bamzai of Open magazine writes this about Bheem's attack on the governor's palace, "The animals, ranging from tigers to stags, run riot, tearing the enemy to bits. It is both a metaphor and a state­ment. A metaphor for the weaponisation of the Earth, a foreshadowing of climate change, and a statement on the tribal way of life in which the human apologises to the beast for taking advantage of it." She noted that the film's layered storytelling emphasising the two conflicting ways in which Ram and Bheem fight for India's freedom is a theme that is appropriate to revisit in the nation's 75th year post-independence. She also notes, "The fight against the British is shown to be as plural as the actual freedom struggle was. Bheem, in fact, spends much of the movie disguised as a Muslim mechanic, Akhtar, and is given shelter by a family in Delhi. There is no pandering to the establishment in the movie, a hallmark of most movies emerg­ing out of Bollywood currently."[120]
                
                Katie Rife of Polygon in her review of the film, felt that — betrayal, loyalty and legacy are the major themes of the film. Also, she opined that "RRR is relatively light on music and romance, devoting much of its screen time to visual spectacle, gonzo action, and patriotic zeal. The dynamic between Bheem and Raju has shades of the macho bromance of John Woo's 1980s movies, until the film transforms into a superhero team-up".[132] MensXP in their article praising Rajamouli, opined that strong representation of heroism in the film was one of the key reasons for the film's success.[133]</p>
